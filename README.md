Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton determined completely by an initial state a few simple rules: 

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

The goal of this project was to increase understanding of the internals of a computer through progamming 
complex features in ARM assembly. 

## Technologies 
Code was ran on an Atmel SAM4S and written directly in ARM assembly. LED display was done on a 32x32 LED matrix 
requiring manual row/column-wise refreshing.
